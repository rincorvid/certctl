FreeBSD does not, and can not warrant that the certification authorities
whose certificates are included in this package have in any way been
audited for trustworthiness or RFC 3647 compliance.

Assessment and verification of trust is the complete responsibility of
the system administrator.

This package uses certctl(8) to generate and manage the certificate bundle
files and symlinks that support root certificate discovery for software
that either uses cryptographic libraries other than OpenSSL, or uses
OpenSSL but does not follow recommended practice.
